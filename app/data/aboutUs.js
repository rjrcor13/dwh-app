			`Divine Word Hospital is a Catholic tertiary, Level 3, 179 bed hospital
            located in Tacloban City, Leyte. Region VIII or Eastern Visayas has a
            population of 4,089,734 (as of year 2010) with 78% of population
            living in the rural area and 21.8% in the cities. Of the 70% living in
            the cities about 547,000 live below poverty line.`,
			`In 1964, Father Earnest Hoerdemann, SVD, rector of the Divine Word
            College took up the plan for a Catholic Hospital in Region VIII.
            With the help of German government and German Bishops, missionaries
            and other generous benefactors, the Society of the Divine Word (SVD)
            Fathers in collaboration with the Missionary Benedictine Sisters of
            Tutzing (MBS), Germany, established a 100 bed Hospital equipped with
            modern facilities. The hospital became the training hospital for the
            College of Nursing, Medical Technology, Medicine and other
            paramedical courses of Divine Word College that later became Divine
            Word University (DWU).`,
			`On February 7, 1965, the hospital was blessed and inaugurated. The
            following day, patients were admitted. The SVD Fathers who owned the
            DWU gave full administration of the Divine Word hospital (DWH) to
            the Philippine Province of the MBS of Tutzing, Germany.`,
			`Divine Word Hospital has been at the forefront in offering new
            services. It was the first to open a Dizziness, Hearing and Voice
            Center and a Neurosciences Unit; and also, the first to offer
            Hemodialysis, CT scan, Digital Mammography and Magnetic Resonance
            Imaging (MRI) in Region VIII.`,
			`The diagnostic services of the hospital are among the best equipped
            in the Region.`,
			`The Residency Training Programs of the Department of Medicine and
            the Department of Pediatrics are accredited by their respective
            Specialty Societies. At present, the hospital is working towards the
            accreditation of the Residency Training Program of the Department of
            Obstetrics and Gynecology and the Department of Surgery`,
			`At present the hospital with 179 bed capacity has 17 service beds
            assigned to indigent patients. Currently it has over 400 employees.`,
			`The hospital has a competent staff with active and visiting
            consultants, resident physicians, nurses, other personnel who are
            responsible for efficient and effective care of patients. The
            patient regardless of race, creed, and status in life is treated as
            someone sacred, any person who suffers is sacred to us, because of
            Him whom he/she resembles. Any person who nurses or helps someone to
            his feet, who consoles or heals is even more completely the image of
            Christ.`,
