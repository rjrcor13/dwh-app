					Divine Word Hospital is a Catholic tertiary, Level 3, 179 bed hospital
					located in Tacloban City, Leyte. Region VIll or Eastern Visayas has a
					population of 4,089,734 (as of year 2010) with 78% of population
					living in the rural area and 21.8% in the cities. Of the 70% living in

					<p>
						In 1964, Father Earnest Hoerdemann, SVD, rector of the Divine Word
						College took up the plan for a Catholic Hospital in Region VIII.
						With the help of German government and German Bishops, missionaries
						and other generous benefactors, the Society of the Divine Word (SVD)
						Fathers in collaboration with the Missionary Benedictine Sisters of
						Tutzing (MBS), Germany, established a 100 bed Hospital equipped with
						modern facilities. The hospital became the training hospital for the
						College of Nursing, Medical Technology, Medicine and other
						paramedical courses of Divine Word College that later became Divine
						Word University (DWU).
					</p>
					<p>
						On February 7, 1965, the hospital was blessed and inaugurated. The
						following day, patients were admitted. The SVD Fathers who owned the
						DWU gave full administration of the Divine Word hospital (DWH) to
						the Philippine Province of the MBS of Tutzing, Germany.
					</p>
					<p>
						Divine Word Hospital has been at the forefront in offering new
						services. It was the first to open a Dizziness, Hearing and Voice
						Center and a Neurosciences Unit; and also, the first to offer
						Hemodialysis, CT scan, Digital Mammography and Magnetic Resonance
						Imaging (MRI) in Region VIII.
					</p>
					<p>
						The diagnostic services of the hospital are among the best equipped
						in the Region.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Residency Training Programs of the Department of Medicine and
						the Department of Pediatrics are accredited by their respective
						Specialty Societies. At present, the hospital is working towards the
						accreditation of the Residency Training Program of the Department of
						Obstetrics and Gynecology and the Department of Surgery
					</p>
					<p>
						At present the hospital with 179 bed capacity has 17 service beds
						assigned to indigent patients. Currently it has over 400 employees.
					</p>
					<p>
						The hospital has a competent staff with active and visiting
						consultants, resident physicians, nurses, other personnel who are
						responsible for efficient and effective care of patients. The
						patient regardless of race, creed, and status in life is treated as
						someone sacred, any person who suffers is sacred to us, because of
						Him whom he/she resembles. Any person who nurses or helps someone to
						his feet, who consoles or heals is even more completely the image of
						Christ.
